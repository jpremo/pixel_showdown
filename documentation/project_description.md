# Description for Pixel Showdown #
Pixel Showdown is a website aimed at encouraging creativity and friendly competition. Users who are logged in will be able to draw sketches, create competitions, create competition rule sets, participate in competitions and make posts. A key focus of this website is drawing pixel art. As such, it will include a customizable pixel art canvas/editor.

When creating a competition rule set, users will be able to set time limits, submission number limits, a description of the challenge, canvas size, colors available, and tools available. Users can use a competition rule set to create and post a competition of their own for other users to participate in. The creator of the competition will judge the participants and select the top three submissions once the competition time window has expired. Users who win will receive a number of points that scales with the number of competition entries. Additionally, users can make posts including rule sets they have generated and drawings they have made in a free sketch mode.
